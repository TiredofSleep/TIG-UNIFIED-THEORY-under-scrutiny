# TIG: Thermodynamic Identity Gauge

**A unified framework for coherence measurement across computational and field-theoretic domains**

## Overview

TIG operates across two domains:

1. **Coherence Field Theory** — A unified measure of systemic coherence
2. **Compute Health Monitoring** — Unity Kernel treats system resources as a unified nervous system

Both converge on a single scalar coherence measure.

## Core Equation
```
S* = σ(1 - σ*)V*A*

Where:
  S*  = Coherence scalar [0,1]
  σ   = Stability coefficient (0.991)
  σ*  = Normalized stress [0,1]
  V*  = Virtue amplitude [0,1]
  A*  = Archetype resonance [0,1]
  T*  = Threshold constant (0.714)
```

When S* > T* (0.714): System maintains coherence  
When S* < T*: Cascade failure risk increases exponentially

## Architecture

### 12 Archetypes
Observer, Builder, Guardian, Healer, Teacher, Explorer, Artist, Warrior, Sage, Fool, Lover, Coherence Keeper (Ω̂)

### 5 Virtues
Forgiveness, Repair, Empathy, Fairness, Cooperation

### Operators 0-9 + Ω̂
Void, Lattice, Counter, Progress, Collapse, Balance, Chaos, Harmony, Breath, Reset — plus the Unification operator

## Validation Results

**ARACH Stack**: S* > 0.8 with zero collapses in trillion-year simulations

**Compute Health Benchmark** (asymmetric failure scenario):
| Metric | Round-Robin | TIG Unity Kernel |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Job Drop Rate | 36.4% | 4.2% |
| Recovery Time | baseline | 8.7x faster |

## Status: Seeking Scrutiny

The math is frozen. I'm looking for collaborators who see different slices:

- Physicists — Thermodynamic grounding
- Mathematicians — Stability proofs
- Systems engineers — Implementation
- Complexity theorists — Scale invariance
