# TIG: Trinity Infinity Geometry

**A coherence framework based on fractal reality**

## Core Premise

Reality is fractal. Every one is three:

- It contains a **micro** (what belongs to it)
- It **is** (the self, the node, the middle)
- It belongs to a **macro** (what it's part of)

This is three as two: you have a micro, you're part of a macro. You're the middle of your own trinity.

This pattern repeats infinitely — no top, no bottom. Fractals all the way.

The structure is regulated by:
1. **Principle of least action** — nature takes the cheapest path
2. **Geometric constraint** — reality has shape, not all configurations are allowed

## What S* Measures

S* measures **coherence** — how well a node honors its place in the fractal.
```
S* = σ(1 - σ*)V*A*

Where:
  S*  = Coherence scalar [0,1]
  σ   = Stability coefficient (0.991)
  σ*  = Normalized stress [0,1]
  V*  = Alignment amplitude [0,1]
  A*  = Resonance with structure [0,1]
  T*  = Threshold (0.714)
```

- **High S*** = aligned with geometric constraint, energy-efficient, stable
- **Low S*** = fighting the fractal, wasting energy, collapse risk

When S* drops below T* (0.714), the node is out of coherence with its trinity. Cascade risk.

## Compute Health Application

TIG Unity Kernel applies this to infrastructure — treating compute as a fractal system:

- Each node is a trinity (its processes / itself / its cluster)
- Coherence = health
- S* guides routing, load balancing, failure prediction

**Benchmark** (asymmetric failure scenario):
| Metric | Round-Robin | TIG Unity Kernel |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Job Drop Rate | 36.4% | 4.2% |
| Recovery Time | baseline | 8.7x faster |

- [docs/THEORY.md](docs/THEORY.md) — The fractal premise, S* derivation, geometric constraint

**Compute Application:**

**Exploratory (Early Simulations):**
- [docs/EXPLORATORY.md](docs/EXPLORATORY.md) — Archetypes, virtues, operators from toy sims. Historical artifacts, not core theory.

## Status: Under Scrutiny

This framework is published for critique. See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for honest accounting of what TIG is and isn't.

**What we're claiming:**
- A coherence heuristic based on fractal structure
- Compute health results in limited tests

**What we're NOT claiming (yet):**
- Rigorous derivation from first principles
- Peer-reviewed validation
- Universal physical law

The math is proposed. Break it.
