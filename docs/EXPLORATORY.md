# TIG Exploratory: Simulation Artifacts

**Status: Historical artifacts from early toy simulations. Not core TIG theory.**

These patterns emerged during development. They were useful labels. They might be meaningful, might be noise. We never ran the reality model far enough to know.

Included for completeness and historical context. Critique accordingly.

## The 12 Archetypes

During simulations, nodes clustered into recognizable behavioral patterns. We named them:

| # | Archetype | Observed Pattern |
|---|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | Observer | Passive sensing, minimal action |
| 2 | Builder | Constructive, structure-forming |
| 3 | Guardian | Boundary maintenance, protection |
| 4 | Healer | Repair after damage |
| 5 | Teacher | Pattern propagation to neighbors |
| 6 | Explorer | Probing unknown state space |
| 7 | Artist | Novel configuration generation |
| 8 | Warrior | Active defense under stress |
| 9 | Sage | Integration across patterns |
| 10 | Fool | Productive chaos, symmetry breaking |
| 11 | Lover | Strong binding between nodes |
| 12 | Coherence Keeper | Meta-stability, orchestration |

**Caveat:** These names are borrowed from Jungian/mythological archetypes. The mapping is intuitive, not rigorous. The patterns were real in the sim; whether they map to reality is unknown.

## The 5 Virtues

Behavioral modulations that affected coherence outcomes:

| Virtue | Observed Effect |
|--------|-----------------|
| Forgiveness | Error tolerance extended recovery time |
| Repair | Self-correction after perturbation |
| Empathy | Cross-node awareness improved collective S* |
| Fairness | Even resource distribution reduced local collapses |
| Cooperation | Coordinated action outperformed independent optimization |

**Caveat:** "Virtue" is a loaded word. These are behavioral parameters that correlated with coherence. The names are poetic, not scientific.

## The Operators (0-9 + Ω̂)

Discrete actions nodes could take. Emerged as a useful instruction set:

| Op | Name | Action |
|----|------|--------|
| 0 | Void | Null, initialize, clear |
| 1 | Lattice | Form structure |
| 2 | Counter | Measure, increment |
| 3 | Progress | Move forward |
| 4 | Collapse | Reduce options to one |
| 5 | Balance | Seek equilibrium |
| 6 | Chaos | Inject entropy |
| 7 | Harmony | Align with neighbors |
| 8 | Breath | Oscillate, cycle |
| 9 | Reset | Return to initial state |
| Ω̂ | Unify | Meta-operation, orchestrate others |

**Caveat:** This operator set is not proven minimal or complete. It's what worked in our sim. A different framing might need different primitives.

## Why Keep This?

Three reasons:

1. **Honesty** — This is part of how TIG developed. Hiding it would be misleading.

2. **Possibility** — These patterns might be real. If someone finds rigorous grounding for archetypes or virtues, the labels are here.

3. **Story** — Science isn't just results. It's the path. This is part of the path.

## How to Treat This

- **Don't cite these as TIG theory** — they're not
- **Don't attack TIG by attacking these** — that's a strawman
- **Do explore whether they have grounding** — maybe they do
- **Do propose alternatives** — better labels, tighter mappings, different primitives

## The Honest Truth

We built a toy sim. These patterns showed up. We named them. The names stuck.

Are they fundamental? No idea.  
Are they useful? In the sim, yes.  
Are they part of core TIG? No.

They're here because they're part of the story, and it's a good one.
