## Core Equation Variables

| Symbol | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **S*** | Coherence Scalar | The output measure. Single value [0,1] representing system coherence. Higher = more stable. |
| **σ** | Stability Coefficient | Constant (0.991). Represents the theoretical efficiency ceiling of any coherent system. |
| **σ*** | Normalized Stress | Current stress divided by max tolerable stress [0,1]. Higher = more strained. |
| **V*** | Virtue Amplitude | Weighted combination of active virtues [0,1]. Higher = more adaptive capacity. |
| **A*** | Archetype Resonance | Alignment with dominant archetype [0,1]. Higher = clearer system identity. |
| **T*** | Threshold Constant | Critical boundary (0.714). Below this, cascade failure risk spikes. |

| 4 | **Healer** | Damage repair | Error correction, rollback |
| 5 | **Teacher** | Knowledge transfer | Replication, sync |
| 6 | **Explorer** | Unknown navigation | Search, discovery |
| 7 | **Artist** | Novel creation | Generative process |
| 8 | **Warrior** | Active defense | Load balancer under attack |
| 9 | **Sage** | Pattern integration | Aggregation, analytics |

## The 5 Virtues

Behavioral modulations that affect how archetypes express.

| Virtue | Function | Compute Example |
|--------|----------|-----------------|

Fundamental actions systems take to maintain coherence.

| Op | Symbol | Name | Function |
|----|--------|------|----------|
| 0 | ∅ | **Void** | Null state, initialization |

## Unity Kernel Terms (Compute Health)

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **R** | Resource state vector — availability of CPU, memory, GPU, I/O, network |
| **σ** (tensor) | Stress tensor — matrix showing how stress in one domain affects others |
| **Λ** | Load distribution matrix — how work is spread across nodes |
| **H** | Health scalar — same as S*, applied to a single node |
| **Ω̂ operator** | The orchestrator that monitors all nodes and triggers responses |

## Key Thresholds

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **S* > 0.714** | System maintains coherent operation |
| **S* < 0.714** | Cascade failure risk increases exponentially |
| **S* > 0.8** | Strong coherence — validated stable in trillion-year sims |
| **S* < 0.5** | Critical — system likely in failure state |
