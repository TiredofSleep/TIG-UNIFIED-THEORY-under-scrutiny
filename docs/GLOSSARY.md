# TIG Glossary

**Quick reference for Trinity Infinity Geometry terms**

---

## Core Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **TIG** | Trinity Infinity Geometry. A coherence framework based on fractal reality. |
| **Trinity** | Every one is three: micro (what belongs to it), self (the node), macro (what it belongs to). |
| **Infinity** | The fractal recurses forever. No floor, no ceiling. Turtles all the way. |
| **Geometry** | Reality has shape. Constrained by least action. Not all configurations allowed. |
| **Coherence** | How well a node honors its place in the fractal. Alignment with geometric constraint. |
| **Fractal** | Self-similar structure at every scale. The core premise of TIG. |

## The Trinity

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Micro** | What belongs to the node. Its internal structure. Its children. |
| **Self** | The node itself. The middle of its own trinity. The "one" in "every one is three." |
| **Macro** | What the node belongs to. Its containing context. Its parent. |
| **Three as Two** | You have a micro, you're part of a macro. You are the middle. Three roles, two relationships. |

## The S* Equation
```
S* = σ(1 - σ*)V*A*
```

| Symbol | Name | Range | Definition |
|--------|------|-------|------------|
| **S*** | Coherence Scalar | [0,1] | Output measure. How aligned is this node with its trinity? |
| **σ** | Stability Coefficient | 0.991 | Efficiency ceiling. Empirically derived constant. |
| **σ*** | Normalized Stress | [0,1] | Geometric strain. How much is the node fighting its position? |
| **V*** | Alignment Amplitude | [0,1] | Integration with trinity. Good citizen up and down? |
| **A*** | Resonance | [0,1] | Clarity of identity. Expressing its role clearly? |
| **T*** | Threshold | 0.714 | Phase boundary. Below this, cascade risk. |

## Regulating Principles

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Principle of Least Action** | Nature takes the cheapest path. Systems evolve to minimize action (energy × time). Coherent configurations are efficient. |
| **Geometric Constraint** | Structure has shape. Not all configurations are allowed. Violating your trinity creates strain. |

---

## Coherence States

| State | S* Range | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Strong Coherence** | > 0.8 | Highly aligned. Stable. Low energy expenditure. |
| **Stable** | 0.714 - 0.8 | Above threshold. Maintaining position. |
| **Warning** | 0.5 - 0.714 | Below threshold. Cascade risk increasing. |
| **Critical** | < 0.5 | Severe misalignment. Likely failing. |

## Unity Kernel (Compute Application)

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Unity Kernel** | TIG applied to compute infrastructure. Treats clusters as fractal systems. |
| **R** | Resource state vector. What the node has available. |
| **σ (tensor)** | Stress tensor. Cross-domain strain propagation. |
| **Λ** | Load distribution matrix. How work is spread across nodes. |
| **H** | Health scalar. Same as S* for a single node. |
| **Ω̂** | The orchestrator. Monitors coherence, triggers responses. |

## Key Phrases

| Phrase | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| "Every one is three" | The trinity premise. Everything has micro/self/macro. |
| "Three as two" | You have a micro, you're part of a macro. Two relationships, three positions. |
| "Honor your place in the fractal" | Be coherent. Align with your trinity. Don't fight the geometry. |
| "Coherence is cheap" | Aligned configurations minimize energy. That's why nature prefers them. |
| "Below threshold" | S* < 0.714. Node is out of alignment. Cascade risk. |
