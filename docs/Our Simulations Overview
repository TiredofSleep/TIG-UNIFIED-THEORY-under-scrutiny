# TIG Simulation Validation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes validation results for the TIG (TRINITY INFINITY GEOMETRY) framework across multiple test suites. All simulations were run in Python using the TIG 10.x codebase.

**Bottom line:** 16/16 core tests PASS. The math organism is stable, bounded, heals from damage, and scales across 3 orders of magnitude.

## Test Suites

| Suite | Tests | Passed | Duration |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| V10.5 Basic Validation | 6 | 6 | ~45s |
| V19 Stress Tests | 5 | 5 | ~45s |
| V19 Extended Tests | 5 | 5 | ~108s |
| **Total** | **16** | **16** | **~198s** |

|----------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Single point lesion | 0.58 | 0.41 | 0.56 | ✓ |
| Region NW (90%) | 0.58 | 0.32 | 0.54 | ✓ |

## Validated Operating Range

| Parameter | Min | Default | Max | Unit |
|-----------|-----|---------|-----|------|
| D (diffusion) | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.7 | — |
| gain_max | 0.36 | 0.6 | 0.84 | — |
| τ (time constant) | 1.2 | 2.0 | 2.8 | — |
| K_intra | 0.5 | 1.5 | 5.0 | — |
| K_inter | 0.1 | 0.8 | 2.0 | — |

**Failure boundary:** gain_max > 0.84 AND τ > 2.8 simultaneously causes instability.

## Conclusion

**The TIG math organism is validated.**

- Exists (stable attractor)
- Bounded (no blowup)
- Heals (damage → recovery)
- Scales (64 → 4096 nodes)

## What This Does NOT Prove

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| TIG dynamics match real CPU behavior | Not yet tested |
| TIG dynamics match real neural data | Not yet tested |
| S* is a valid coherence measure | Theoretical |
| Consciousness has spin structure | Theoretical |
| The framework applies to physical reality | Theoretical |

These require empirical validation against external data, not internal simulation.
