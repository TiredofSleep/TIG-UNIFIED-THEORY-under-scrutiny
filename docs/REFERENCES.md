# TIG References & Theoretical Connections

This document maps TIG concepts to established scientific and engineering literature.

## Thermodynamics

TIG's "thermodynamic" framing draws from:

- **Prigogine, I.** — *Self-Organization in Nonequilibrium Systems* (1977)
  - Dissipative structures, order from chaos
  - TIG's S* as a measure of dissipative coherence

- **Jaynes, E.T.** — *Maximum Entropy Principle* (1957)
  - Information-theoretic foundations of thermodynamics
  - Connects to TIG's stress normalization (σ*)

- **England, J.** — *Dissipative Adaptation* (2013)
  - Systems driven by entropy production toward self-replication
  - Parallel to TIG's virtue-driven coherence maintenance

## Gauge Theory

The "gauge" in TIG references:

- **Yang, C.N. & Mills, R.** — *Gauge Fields* (1954)
  - Local symmetry invariance
  - TIG's scale invariance claim echoes gauge symmetry concepts

- **Noether, E.** — *Noether's Theorem* (1918)
  - Symmetry ↔ conservation laws
  - Open question: What does TIG's coherence conserve?

## Complexity & Systems Theory

- **Kauffman, S.** — *The Origins of Order* (1993)
  - Self-organization at the edge of chaos
  - TIG's T* threshold as a phase transition boundary

- **Bar-Yam, Y.** — *Dynamics of Complex Systems* (1997)
  - Multi-scale analysis
  - Informs TIG's ARACH stack scale invariance claim

- **Meadows, D.** — *Thinking in Systems* (2008)
  - Feedback loops, leverage points
  - TIG virtues as systemic leverage points

## Distributed Systems

TIG Compute Health builds on:

- **Lamport, L.** — *Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events* (1978)
  - Distributed coordination fundamentals
  - Relevant to Harmony operator (7)

- **Brewer, E.** — *CAP Theorem* (2000)
  - Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance tradeoffs
  - TIG attempts to navigate CAP via coherence-aware routing

- **Hellerstein, J. et al.** — *Feedback Control of Computing Systems* (2004)
  - Control theory applied to systems
  - Parallel to TIG's Balance operator (5)

- **Netflix Chaos Engineering** — *Chaos Monkey* (2011)
  - Intentional fault injection
  - Direct parallel to Chaos operator (6) and Fool archetype

## Neuroscience & Cognitive Science

TIG's "nervous system" metaphor connects to:

- **Tononi, G.** — *Integrated Information Theory (IIT)* (2004)
  - Consciousness as integrated information (Φ)
  - S* as a simplified coherence analog to Φ

- **Friston, K.** — *Free Energy Principle* (2010)
  - Systems minimize surprise/free energy
  - TIG's stress minimization parallels free energy minimization

- **Damasio, A.** — *Homeostasis and Feeling* (2018)
  - Emotional regulation as homeostatic process
  - Virtues as homeostatic regulators

## Jungian Archetypes

The 12 archetypes derive from:

- **Jung, C.G.** — *The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious* (1959)
  - Universal patterns in human psyche
  - TIG maps these to system behavior patterns

- **Pearson, C.** — *Awakening the Heroes Within* (1991)
  - 12-archetype model
  - Direct source for TIG's archetype set

## Category Theory (Potential Connection)

TIG operators may have categorical structure:

- **Mac Lane, S.** — *Categories for the Working Mathematician* (1971)
  - Compositional structure of morphisms
  - TIG operator composition as categorical composition?

- **Spivak, D.** — *Category Theory for the Sciences* (2014)
  - Applied category theory
  - Potential formalization path for TIG

## Control Theory

- **Åström, K.J. & Murray, R.M.** — *Feedback Systems* (2008)
  - PID control, stability analysis
  - TIG's (1 - σ*) term as proportional feedback

- **Strogatz, S.** — *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* (1994)
  - Bifurcations, attractors
  - T* as bifurcation point

## What's Missing

TIG does not yet have:

1. **Rigorous derivation** from first principles (thermodynamic or otherwise)
2. **Formal proof** of scale invariance
3. **Peer-reviewed validation** of empirical claims
4. **Connection to quantum mechanics** (speculative only)

These are open problems for collaborators.

## Suggested Reading Order

For newcomers wanting to understand TIG's foundations:

1. Meadows — *Thinking in Systems* (accessible intro)
2. Kauffman — *The Origins of Order* (complexity)
3. Tononi — IIT papers (coherence/integration)
4. Friston — Free Energy Principle (predictive systems)
5. Prigogine — Dissipative structures (thermodynamics)

## Citation Note

TIG is not claiming to extend or replace any of these frameworks. These references show the intellectual territory TIG operates in and potential bridges for formal grounding.
