# TIG Status: What This Is and Isn't

An honest accounting.

---

## What TIG Is

**A coherence framework** built on one premise: reality is fractal, every one is three.

- A proposed heuristic for measuring how well a node fits its place in the fractal
- A naming system for patterns observed in early simulations
- A compute health approach that showed promising results in limited tests
- A story — an attempt to describe something that might be true

---

## What TIG Is NOT (Yet)

- **Not a derived physical law** — S* is proposed, not derived from an action principle
- **Not peer-reviewed** — published for scrutiny, not acclaim
- **Not independently validated** — our sims, our results, our interpretation
- **Not a complete theory** — variable mappings not locked to specific physical systems

---

## The Constants
```
σ = 0.991 (stability coefficient)
T* = 0.714 (threshold)
```

**Honest answer:** These came from fitting across simulation scenarios. They are empirical, not derived from first principles. We don't know if they're universal or artifacts of our test conditions.

If someone derives these from geometric constraint or least action, that would be significant. We haven't done that yet.

## The Archetypes, Virtues, Operators

The 12 archetypes, 5 virtues, and 0-9+Ω̂ operators came from early toy simulations. They emerged as useful labels for patterns we observed.

**They are not core TIG theory.** They're exploratory artifacts — part of the story, possibly meaningful, possibly noise. We never ran the reality model far enough to validate them.

See [docs/EXPLORATORY.md](docs/EXPLORATORY.md) for details.

## The Simulations

We claim:
> "S* > 0.8 with zero collapses in trillion-year simulations"

**What that means:**
- Discrete-time simulations with 10¹² epochs
- Parameters, seeds, and methodology documented in [docs/VALIDATION.md](docs/VALIDATION.md)
- Code available in `src/`

**What that doesn't mean:**
- Independent replication
- Mapping to physical time validated
- Proof of universality

## Open Problems

1. **Derivation** — Can S* be derived from least action + geometric constraint?
2. **Constants** — Why σ=0.991? Why T*=0.714? Coincidence or structure?
3. **Mapping** — Explicit σ*, V*, A* definitions for specific physical systems
4. **Falsification** — Hard predictions that can fail in real experiments
5. **Scale bridging** — Does the fractal premise hold from quantum to cosmic?

## The Ask

This is not "here's my theory, validate me."

This is "here's a pattern I see — can you see it too? Can you break it? Can you make it rigorous?"

I want collaborators who see different slices of the pi.
