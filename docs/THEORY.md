# TIG Theory: Trinity Infinity Geometry

**The fractal premise and coherence mathematics**

---

## 1. The Core Premise

Reality is fractal. Every one is three.

Any node — a particle, a person, a process, a planet — exists as:

- **Micro**: What belongs to it (its internal structure)
- **Self**: The node itself (the middle, the "one")
- **Macro**: What it belongs to (its containing context)

This is three as two. You have a micro. You're part of a macro. You are the middle of your own trinity.

The pattern recurses infinitely. Your micro has its own micro. Your macro has its own macro. No floor, no ceiling. Turtles all the way down, all the way up.

## 2. The Regulating Principles

Infinite fractalization doesn't mean chaos. Two principles constrain the geometry:

### Principle of Least Action

Nature doesn't waste. Systems evolve along paths that minimize action — the integral of energy over time. This isn't a suggestion; it's how physics works, from quantum mechanics to general relativity.

In TIG terms: coherent configurations are cheap. Incoherent configurations cost energy. Reality prefers coherence because coherence is efficient.

### Geometric Constraint

Not all configurations are allowed. Structure has shape. The fractal has rules.

A node that violates its trinity — ignoring its micro, fighting its macro — creates geometric strain. The structure pushes back. This is felt as stress, resistance, eventual collapse.

---

## 3. Coherence as Alignment

**Coherence** in TIG means: a node honoring its place in the fractal.

- Coherent with micro: properly relating to what's inside you
- Coherent with macro: properly fitting what contains you
- Coherent with self: being what you are, not fighting your position

High coherence = low energy expenditure = stable  
Low coherence = high energy expenditure = unstable

This is why S* works as a health metric. It's measuring alignment with geometric constraint.

## 4. The S* Equation
```
S* = σ(1 - σ*)V*A*
```

### The Variables

| Symbol | Name | Interpretation |
|--------|------|----------------|
| S* | Coherence scalar | Output measure [0,1]. How aligned is this node? |
| σ | Stability coefficient | 0.991. The efficiency ceiling. |
| σ* | Normalized stress | [0,1]. How much geometric strain? |
| V* | Alignment amplitude | [0,1]. How well integrated with trinity? |
| A* | Resonance | [0,1]. How clearly expressing its position? |
| T* | Threshold | 0.714. Below this, cascade risk. |

### Reading the Equation

- **(1 - σ*)**: As stress increases, coherence decreases. Fighting the geometry costs.
- **V* × A***: Alignment and resonance multiply. You need both. Clear identity (A*) without integration (V*) is brittle. Integration without identity is diffuse.
- **σ**: The ceiling. Even perfect alignment can't exceed ~0.991. There's always overhead in maintaining coherence.

### The Threshold

When S* > T* (0.714): Node maintains coherence with its trinity.  
When S* < T*: Node is out of alignment. Energy expenditure rises. Cascade failure risk increases.

T* marks a phase boundary. Above it, the geometry holds. Below it, strain accumulates faster than it dissipates.

## 5. Scale Invariance

Because the premise is fractal, S* should work at any scale:

- A cell in a body
- A person in a family
- A server in a cluster
- A planet in a solar system

The variables (σ*, V*, A*) need domain-specific definitions, but the equation structure holds. Coherence is coherence.

This is a claim, not a proof. It's what the fractal premise predicts. Testing it across domains is an open problem.

---

## 6. Why These Constants?

**σ = 0.991**

Empirically derived. Across our simulations, this value minimized prediction error.

Speculation: ~0.9% overhead may represent irreducible cost of maintaining coherence — the energy required to hold a position in the fractal. Similar to thermodynamic efficiency limits.

Not proven. Open question.

**T* = 0.714**

Empirically derived. This threshold best separated stable from unstable configurations.

Speculation: 0.714 ≈ 5/7 ≈ 1 - 1/e². May relate to geometric properties of the fractal. May be coincidence.

Not proven. Open question.

## 7. Connection to Physics

TIG claims alignment with, not replacement of, established physics:

**Least Action**: The principle of least action is foundational in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and field theory. TIG inherits this.

**Geometric Constraint**: General relativity describes gravity as geometry. TIG extends this intuition: all structure is geometric, and geometry constrains configuration.

**Thermodynamics**: Coherence minimizes energy expenditure. This parallels free energy minimization in statistical mechanics.

**What's Missing**: A rigorous derivation showing S* emerges from an action principle. We propose the connection; we haven't proven it.

---

## 8. What This Predicts

If TIG is correct:

1. Systems below T* should show increased failure/transition rates
2. Interventions that raise V* or A* should improve stability
3. The equation should apply across scales with appropriate variable mapping
4. The constants σ and T* should appear in diverse systems (if truly geometric)

These are testable. Breaking them breaks TIG.

---

## 9. What This Doesn't Explain (Yet)

- Why this specific equation form and not another
- Derivation of σ and T* from first principles
- Explicit mapping of V* and A* to physical observables in specific systems
- How to measure "alignment with trinity" operationally in arbitrary domains

These are open problems. Solving them would elevate TIG from heuristic to theory.

---

## 10. Summary

**Trinity**: Every one is three (micro/self/macro)  
**Infinity**: Fractal recursion, no top or bottom  
**Geometry**: Least action + constraint determines allowed configurations

**S***: Measures how well a node honors its place in the fractal  
**High S***: Aligned, efficient, stable  
**Low S***: Strained, costly, collapse risk

The math is proposed. The premise is clear. Now break it or ground it.
